Welcome to **ZomPy** homepage (for now). This project was born as a result of many studies and manual analysis I did on vertical jumps during my PhD years.

The idea is to combine a proper literature review (with (and its main findings) to create a complete, automated, ready-to-use jump analysis tool for sport scientists.

The final software, now still at its beta stage, would be capable of:

- Analyzing different types of jumps (e.g. CMJ, SJ, DJ, etc.);
- Making use of measures coming from different instruments, i.e. IMUs and force platforms;
- Correcting for IMU inaccuracies through scientifically approved/published methodologies;
- Understanding if a jump has been executed in the proper way or not;
- Being used by everyone, as a GUI will be designed;
- Being both cross-platform and open source, as everyone can have a look beneath the GUI surface.

...and, why not: to test my abilities, not only at coding something different from a script, but at organizing the knowledge I acquired during these years.
